# Last.fm-Analysis
Analysis of my personal data from Last.fm. You can download your data by https://benjaminbenben.com/lastfm-to-csv/, so I didn't put there my own scrobbles.
Code include data cleaning and manipulating to get proper format and animated plot that shows my most listened artist by time. It will be hourplot and maybe visualisation by weeks soon.
